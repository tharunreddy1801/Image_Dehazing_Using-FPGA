##  Overview

This project presents a hardware-accelerated, real-time image dehazing pipeline, fully implemented in Verilog and synthesized on a Xilinx ZedBoard FPGA (Zynq-7000). The goal is to achieve high-performance image dehazing using a custom pipelined architecture based on the Dark Channel Prior and Scene Radiance Recovery methods, optimized for fixed-point arithmetic and stream-based throughput. 

 The pipeline receives BMP images via UART, processes them to remove haze, and returns the reconstructed haze-free image back to the host PC.


---
##  Motivation

  Hazy or foggy images reduce visibility and impair the performance of vision-based systems in applications such as:
- Autonomous driving 
- Aerial and satellite imaging 
- Surveillance systems 
- Remote sensing in adverse weather conditions 
  
  Real-time haze removal is computationally expensive on general-purpose CPUs. To address this, the design uses a custom FPGA-based hardware accelerator to:
- Achieve parallelism
- Support stream-based pipelining
- Enable real-time dehazing on-chip
- Reduce latency compared to software solutions
  
---

##  Objectives

-  **Accelerate DCP-based dehazing** using FPGA for real-time performance.
-  **Modular Verilog Implementation** of each processing stage: dark channel, atmospheric light, transmission map, and restoration.
-  **Optimize for low-latency and energy efficiency** using pipelining and parallelism.
-  Integrate with high-level tools like **MATLAB (HDL Coder)** and **Python** for simulation and visualization.
-  Enable **deployment on embedded platforms** (Zynq SoC) with **AXI-stream interface**.

2.Transmission Estimation
3.Scene Radiance Recovery

## Hardware Architecture
  The complete hardware pipeline is organized into modular Verilog blocks as follows:

### 1. WindowGenerator
- Extracts 3×3 RGB window using 4 line buffers
- Outputs 9 pixels (in1 to in9) in parallel
- Used in both ALE and TE stages
- Easily scalable to generate larger windows
### 2. ALE (Atmospheric Light Estimation)
- Computes per-pixel minimum(R, G, B)
- Performs 3×3 spatial minimum using comparator trees
- Computes the dark channel per 3x3 RGB window
- Selects brightest pixel from the dark channel of the frame
- Calculates inverse atmospheric light for TE stage
- Fully pipelined and stream-compatible
### 3. TE (Transmission Estimation)
- Estimates pixel-wise haze using:
- t(x) = 1 - ω * min(R, G, B) / A
- ω = 0.9375 is implemented as a constant
- All operations use Q0.16 fixed-point arithmetic
### 4. SRSC (Scene Radiance and Scaling Correction)
- Computes:
   J(x) = (I(x) - A) / max(t(x), t₀) + A
- Handles division using reciprocal lookup
- Ensures t(x) ≥ t₀ = 0.25 (Q0.16)
- Produces dehazed RGB output
### 5. TE_and_SRSC
- 8-stage pipelined core combining TE and SRSC
- Improves throughput by eliminating intermediate buffering
- Maintains valid signal propagation across pipeline
